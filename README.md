# I-24 MOTION data documentation
- - -

I-24 MOTION is an open-road traffic science instrument and testbed located on Interstate 24 in southeast Nashville, TN, USA. The system uses 294 cameras and a cluster of data processing hardware and software to produce anonymized trajectories for all vehicles on the roadway. This repository maintains versioned documentation for I-24 MOTION data, which is free to download from the [project website](https://i24motion.org). 

As the data processing for the system improves, new data will be assigned an updated version number. Tagged datasets (e.g., the initial "INCEPTION" dataset released by the project) may be re-processed and updated to new data versions. While backwards compatibility of the data, documentation, and software tools may not be maintained, prior versions of documentation and tools will be available in this repository and others in [the I-24 MOTION Github Organization](https://github.com/I24-MOTION). As a general principle, this documentation will receive an updated version number only when compatibility or consistency is broken across data versions. Minor clarifications or bug fixes may be made to the documentation without a version change, but will be reflected in the commit log.

We encourage data users to help us track data improvements, requests, questions, issues, and oddities at our [I-24 MOTION Improvement Tracker repository](https://github.com/I24-MOTION/I24M_improvement_tracker).

This documentation and the data it references are brought to you by the I-24 MOTION team at Vanderbilt University, in addition to project partners at the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Gresham Smith. The full team listing can be found [here](https://i24motion.org/team). Data and software contributions were principally made, and continue, by (in alphabetical order) William Barbour, Derek Gloudemans, Junyi Ji, Yanbing Wang, and Gergely Zachár. Many others contributed in countless ways to make the project possible. Please refer to the project website if you would like to get connected with the team.
